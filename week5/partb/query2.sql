-- We want to find out how many of each category of film ED CHASE has starred in.

-- So return a table with category_name and the count of the number_of_films that ED was in that category.

-- Your query should return every category even if ED has been in no films in that category

-- Order by the category name in ascending order.


SELECT c.name as category_name, COUNT(a.actor_id) as number_of_films FROM category AS c LEFT JOIN film_category AS fc ON c.category_id = fc.category_id
LEFT JOIN film AS f ON fc.film_id = f.film_id LEFT JOIN film_actor AS fa ON f.film_id = fa.film_id 
LEFT JOIN actor AS a ON fa.actor_id = a.actor_id AND a.first_name = 'ED' AND a.last_name = 'CHASE'
GROUP BY c.category_id, c.name
